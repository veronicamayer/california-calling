For this project I utilized the position property in CSS to precisely place elements on the page. To add some flair, I incorporated a small animation to make it more dynamic. 

Please mind that this page is not fully responsive yet and was developed on a 1440px x 735px screen. If your screen is significantly smaller or larger than that the page will probably not look very aligned. 

For a fully responsive project, check out this one instead.
